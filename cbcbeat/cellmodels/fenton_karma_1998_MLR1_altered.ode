# A Simplified Ventricular Myocyte Model
#
# ABSTRACT: Wave propagation in ventricular muscle is rendered highly anisotropic
# by the intramural rotation of the fiber. This rotational anisotropy is
# especially important because it can produce a twist of electrical vortices,
# which measures the rate of rotation (in degree/mm) of activation wavefronts in
# successive planes perpendicular to a line of phase singularity, or filament.
# This twist can then significantly alter the dynamics of the filament. This
# paper explores this dynamics via numerical simulation. After a review of the
# literature, we present modeling tools that include: (i) a simplified ionic
# model with three membrane currents that approximates well the restitution
# properties and spiral wave behavior of more complex ionic models of cardiac
# action potential (Beeler-Reuter and others), and (ii) a semi-implicit algorithm
# for the fast solution of monodomain cable equations with rotational anisotropy.
# We then discuss selected results of a simulation study of vortex dynamics in a
# parallelepipedal slab of ventricular muscle of varying wall thickness (S) and
# fiber rotation rate (theta(z)). The main finding is that rotational anisotropy
# generates a sufficiently large twist to destabilize a single transmural
# filament and cause a transition to a wave turbulent state characterized by a
# high density of chaotically moving filaments. This instability is manifested by
# the propagation of localized disturbances along the filament and has no
# previously known analog in isotropic excitable media. These disturbances
# correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of filament, or "twistons,"
# that create vortex rings when colliding with the natural boundaries of the
# ventricle. Moreover, when sufficiently twisted, these rings expand and create
# additional filaments by further colliding with boundaries. This instability
# mechanism is distinct from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave breakup
# that is not observed here during the initial instability. For modified
# Beeler-Reuter-like kinetics with stable reentry in two dimensions, decay into
# turbulence occurs in the left ventricle in about one second above a critical
# wall thickness in the range of 4-6 mm that matches experiment. However this
# decay is suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability. Specific experiments
# to test these results, and a method to characterize the filament density during
# fibrillation are discussed. Results are contrasted with other mechanisms of
# fibrillation and future prospects are summarized.
