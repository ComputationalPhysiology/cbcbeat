This subpackage provides a collection of "cardiac cell models" in the
form of Python modules.

Each Python module (x.py) is automatically generated (with a few
exceptions detailed below) from the corresponding Gotran file (x.ode)
via the script ../../scripts/gotran2beat:

    gotran2beat x.ode

There are two exceptions, namely

  * fitzhughnagumo_manual.py
  * nocellmodel.py

These modules were written by hand with equations based on "Computing
the electrical activity in the heart" by Sundnes et al, 2006.

[Developer note: The manually written modules should be removed once
the autogenerated modules are properly verified.]

FIXME: Maleckar 2009 is in s not ms and need to be scaled before added as a valid cell model.
