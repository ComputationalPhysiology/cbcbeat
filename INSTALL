Installation:
-------------

cbcbeat can be installed as any other Python module using
distutils:

For system-wise install do:

  sudo python setup.py install

Or specify a local path:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/favorite-path

Tests and demos can be run without installation by adding the top
level directory to your PYTHONPATH:

  export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH

Verifying the installation:
---------------------------

The tests are based on pytest (pytest.org). The installation can be
verified by running the collection of tests located under test/.

For quick testing, run

  cd test
  py.test -m "fast" -v

See test/README for more details on running the test suite.

Dependencies:
-------------

cbcbeat depends on the following software

* Python 2

* The FEniCS Project software: www.fenicsproject.org

  The FEniCS Project is a collection of software for automated
  solution of partial differential equations using finite element
  methods.

  cbcbeat is compatible with FEniCS version 2017.1.0 and 2017.2.0 (and
  possibly 2016.1.0, 2016.2.0) or development versions in between
  these releases of FEniCS.

  Docker images are available for these versions of FEniCS, see
  https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/docker and
  https://quay.io/organization/fenicsproject. For instance, to run the
  2017.1.0 image:

    docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:2017.1.0
    cd shared

* [Optional] dolfin-adjoint: www.dolfin-adjoint.org (compatible with
  FEniCS version)

  dolfin-adjoint provides tools for automatically deriving the
  discrete adjoint and tangent linear models from a DOLFIN forward
  model. NB: cbcbeat depends on dolfin-adjoint/libadjoint

* [Optional] gotran: https://bitbucket.org/johanhake/gotran

  Gotran is a general ODE translator.

  cbcbeat uses Gotran for generating cbcbeat-compatible cell model
  implementations from cellML.

* [Optional] Sphinx: sphinx-doc.org

  Sphinx is a tool for generating documentation for Python module

* [Optional] Model Parameters: https://bitbucket.org/johanhake/modelparameters

  Model Parameters is a Python library for easy use of parameters in
  Python models, written by Johan Hake. Obtain by

    bzr branch lp:modelparameters

  This module is only required for running some of the tests (and this
  dependency will be removed).

* [Optional] py.test (pytest.org)

  This testing tools is used for, well: the tests.
