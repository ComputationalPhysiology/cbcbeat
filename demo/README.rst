I'm a new user, where do I start?
=================================

If you are interested in just using cbcbeat for forward
electrophysiology simulations, start by looking at

  monodomain/demo_monodomain.py

If you are interested in using cbcbeat for computing functional
sensitivities, continue by looking at

  monodomain/demo_monodomain_adjoint.py

If you would like to look at a more realistic example, take a look at 

  bidomain-biventricular/demo_*.py

Conventions for adding new demos
================================

* Please prefix all new demos filenames with demo_
