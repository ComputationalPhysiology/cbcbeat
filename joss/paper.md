# Summary

cbcbeat [@cbcbeat] is a Python-based software collection targeting
computational cardiac electrophysiology problems. cbcbeat contains
solvers of varying complexity and performance for the classical
monodomain and bidomain equations coupled with cardiac cell
models. The cbcbeat solvers are based on algorithms described in
[@SundnesEtAl2006] and the core FEniCS Project software
[@LoggEtAl2012]. All solvers allow for automated derivation and
computation of adjoint and tangent linear solutions, functional
derivatives and Hessians via the dolfin-adjoint software
[@FarrellEtAl2013]. The computation of functional derivatives in turn
allows for automated and efficient solution of optimization problems
such as those encountered in data assimillation or other inverse
problems.

The cbcbeat source code is hosted with Bitbucket
(https://bitbucket.org/meg/cbcbeat) with documentation on readthedocs
(http://cbcbeat.readthedocs.io).
